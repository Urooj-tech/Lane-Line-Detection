    "# 🔍 Objective of the Project\n",
    "The main objective of this project is to detect lane lines on roads using a video feed. This is a fundamental task in autonomous driving systems, where identifying road lanes helps vehicles stay in their lane and navigate properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 🎯 Purpose of the Project\n",
    ">Develop a simple lane detection system using image processing.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Understand key computer vision techniques like edge detection, masking, and line detection.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Practice real-time video processing with OpenCV.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 🧠 Importance of Lane Detection\n",
    ">Core component of self-driving cars – helps in path planning and avoiding accidents.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Assists in driver safety systems – like lane departure warning systems.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Applies computer vision concepts in a real-world scenario.\n",
    "# 🧱 Step-by-Step Working of the Code\n",
    "#### Step 1: Read Video Frame-by-Frame\n",
    "                                          cap = cv2.VideoCapture(video_path)\n",
    ">The program loads a video file to be processed.\n",
    "\n",
    ">It then reads and processes each frame continuously inside a loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Edge Detection using Canny\n",
    "                                         def canny(img):\n",
    "                                         ...\n",

    "                                         canny = cv2.Canny(blur, 50, 150)\n",
    "                                         return canny\n",
    "\n",
    ">The current video frame is first converted to grayscale to simplify the image and reduce complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    ">A Gaussian blur is applied to smooth the image and remove noise.\n",
    "\n",
    ">The Canny edge detector is then used to detect strong edges in the frame, such as lane markings.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 3: Apply Region of Interest (ROI)\n",
    "                                         def region_of_interest(canny):\n",

    "                                         ...\n",
    ">A mask is created that focuses only on the lower part of the image where lanes are usually visible.\n",
    "\n",
    ">This region is shaped like a triangle to simulate the area in front of a moving car.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Only the edges within this region are kept; the rest are ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 4: Detect Line Segments (Hough Transform)\n",

    "\n",
    ">For both left and right lanes, the coordinates of all detected lines are averaged to form one single, clean line on each side.\n",
    "\n",
    ">These averaged lines are then converted into start and end points to be drawn on the image.\n",

    ">The image with the lane lines is combined with the original video frame.\n",
    "\n",
    ">This makes it easier to visualize the lanes directly over the driving scene.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 8: Display the Final Result in Real Time\n",
    "                                    cv2.imshow(\"result\", combo_image)\n",
